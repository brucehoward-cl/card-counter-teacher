        <ol>
            <li>Assign a value to every card</li>
            <li>Keep a “Running Count” based off of the values of the card dealt</li>
            <!-- <li>Use this information to calculate the count per deck or “true count”</li>
            <li>Change your bets as the true count rises</li> -->
