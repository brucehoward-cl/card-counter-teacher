      <h2>House Rules</h2>
      <p>Dealer hits on 16 stays on 17.</p>
      <p>Dealer will not hit on soft seventeen.</p>
      <p>No splits or doubling down is allowed.</p>
      <p>If player busts, he loses the hand, but the dealer will still finish his hand.</p>
      <p>If player gets 21, the dealer still finishes his hand, and if dealer gets 21 the hand is a push. Otherwise, player wins.</p>
      <p>If both player and dealer bust, player loses.</p>
      <p>If the end of the deck is encountered before the hand is completed, player will be prompted whether to continue.</p>
